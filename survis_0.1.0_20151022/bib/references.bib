abstract = {Computer programs able to play different kinds of games (aka bots) is a growing area of interest for the computer game industry as the demand for better skilled computerized opponents increase. We propose a general architecture of a Multi-agent System (Mas) based bot able to play complex board games and show that this solution is able to outperform other bots in two quite different games, namely no-press Diplomacy and Risk. Based on these results, we formulate a hypothesis of the applicability of Mas based bots in the domain of board games and identify the need for future investigations in the area.},

abstract = {In trick-taking card games, a two-step process of state sampling and evaluation is widely used to approximate move values. While the evaluation component is vital, the accuracy of move value estimates is also fundamentally linked to how well the sampling distribution corresponds the true distribution. Despite this, recent work in trick-taking card game AI has mainly focused on improving evaluation algorithms with limited work on improving sampling. In this paper, we focus on the effect of sampling on the strength of a player and propose a novel method of sampling more realistic states given move history. In particular, we use predictions about locations of individual cards made by a deep neural network — trained on data from human gameplay — in order to sample likely worlds for evaluation. This technique, used in conjunction with Perfect Information Monte Carlo (PIMC) search, provides a substantial increase in cardplay strength in the popular trick-taking card game of Skat.},

  abstract={Modern board, card, and video games are challenging domains for AI research due to their complex game mechanics and large state and action spaces. For instance, in Hearthstone — a popular collectible card (CC) (video) game developed by Blizzard Entertainment — two players first construct their own card decks from hundreds different cards and then draw and play cards to cast spells, select weapons, and combat minions and the opponent's hero. Players' turns are often comprised of multiple actions, including drawing new cards, which leads to enormous branching factors that pose a problem for state-of-the-art heuristic search methods. This thesis starts with a brief description of the game of Hearthstone and the modeling and implementation of the Hearthstone simulator that serves as the test environment for our research. Then we present a determinized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based approach for this game and two main contributions of this approach. First, we introduce our chance node bucketing method (CNB) for reducing chance event branching factors by bucketing outcomes with similar outcomes and pre-sampling for each bucket. CNB is incorporated to the in-tree phase of the determinized MCTS algorithm and improves the search efficiency. Second, we define and train high-level policy networks that can be used to enhance the quality of MCTS rollouts and play games independently. We apply these ideas to the game of Hearthstone and show significant improvements over a state-of-the-art AI system.},

We have used this framework in teaching a mixed undergraduate/graduate AI course for six years. We believe that the use of games motivates students. The graphical nature of each game enables students to quickly see how well their algorithm works. Because the topics in an introductory AI course vary widely, students apply their algorithms to multiple game environments. A final challenging environment enables them to tie together the concepts for the entire semester.},

This paper advocates and analyzes the inclusion of board, card, and dice games as programming assignments in introductory programming courses (CS1/2). The simple interface and strategy-based play of these types of games complement the immersive multimedia and agility-based play of video games. The implementation of board, card, and dice games typically demands less background knowledge from the instructor and offers fewer opportunities for extraneous work by the students. The paper lists 32 specific games that are suitable for teaching the major topics in CS1/2 and discusses the implementation of some of these games and their successful use as programming projects.},

The game platform described in this paper adopts Java technology, and uses C/S mode and My SQL database to complete the design of the platform. This game platform has the functions of login module, management module and so on. Through the platform, it can realize jigsaw puzzle, Snake game and real-time battle of LAN tank war game.

abstract = {Learning to code is far from an easy task, it is a promising approach that underscores the use of the video game culture of students to motivate them to invest their time in the practice of programming. The students in this discipline are often discouraged by the amount of information to remember and the complex and constraining syntaxes. Moreover, the computer environment they use daily has little relation to that proposed for learning programming and they do not immediately perceive the links between the two universes. In this article we have proposed a tool which aims to help learners in the one of the different programming language; it's a learning game called Java shooter to promote learning java programming with high motivation rate. This game will allow learners to understand the lessons learned with a kind of interesting motivation. The development of this game idea is carried out using the IMIE model for the creation of learning games, this model is characterized by its clarity, and simplicity of adaptation which give the hand to the teacher to integrate himself in the process of creation in most of the stages of learning, in order to ensure a better pedagogical playful adaptation, whose goal is to integrate this new technology into the education system. Overall, the teachers greatly appreciated the design of the "Java Shooter" which is based on the chosen model in several steps. Analysis of the empirical results shows that most learners have accepted this tool to strengthen the classical teaching materials of Java programming.},
